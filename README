# ============
# REQUIREMENTS
# Python 2.5.1: http://www.python.org/download/
# Psyco: http://psyco.sourceforge.net/
# 
# Perl 5.1.0 (online version only): http://www.perl.org/get.html
# Git 1.6.0.6 (to get updates): http://git-scm.com/download
# 
# This program can be run in two different ways:
# Offline mode and online mode.
#
#
# ============
# OFFLINE MODE
# To run in offline mode, have a file with the turn
# number, whose turn it is to move, and the current
# state of the board. The following is an example:
7g
 +-----------------+
8|   r   r r   r   |
7| m   h     e   c |
6|   r x r r x r   |
5| h   d     c   d |
4| E   H         M |
3|   R x R R H R   |
2| D   C     C   D |
1|   R   R R   R   |
 +-----------------+
   a b c d e d g h
# 
# 7 refers to the turn number, g means that it's gold's
# turn to move, and the board state follows that.
# 
# To determine what the next best move for gold is, type:
  python Driver.py fileName
# inside the directory 'final'
#
# Sample files are included in the 'final/sample_files' directory.
#
#
# ===========
# ONLINE MODE
# In online mode, the program interfaces with the Arimaa
# gameroom. Essentially, the program is consistently called
# with different board states and asked to determine
# the best move for whose turn it is.
#
# To run in online mode, type:
  ./bot
# inside the directory 'bot'
# 
# Then you must enter in the Arimaa gameroom:
# http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/
# where you should see the bot (named "bot_et") at a table.
# There you can sit at the table with the
# bot and play against it.
